cinnamic acid dibromide]], C6H5CHBrCHBrCO2H, [[crystal]]lizes in long needles or prisms which melt at 136–137 °C. When heated with water to 120 °C, it yields [[phenylacetylene]] (C6H5CCH). [[Chromic acid]] [[oxidize]]s it to [[benzoic acid]]; [[zinc]] and [[acetic acid]] reduce it to [[cinnamic acid]], C6H5CH=CHCO2H, whilst [[sodium amalgam]] reduces it to [[hydrocinnamic acid]], C6H5CH2CH2CO2H. Ortho-nitrophenylpropiolic acid, NO2C6H4CCCO2H, prepared by the action of alcoholic potash on ortho-nitrocinnamic acid dibromide, crystallizes in needles which decompose when heated to 155–156 °C. It is readily converted into [[indigo dye

analgesic]] drug which is a [[cannabinoid receptor agonist]]. It is a derivative of [[HU-210]] which has been substituted with a 6β-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl) group. This adds a "southern" [[aliphatic]] [[hydroxyl]] group to the molecule as seen in the [[CP cannabinoids	dibenzopyran	CP 47,497#See_also	cannabinoid]] families, with the 6-hydroxyalkyl chain rigidified with a [[triple bond]].
